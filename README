version 2.00alpha

Changes of Note:

* Complete code rewrite and cleanup.

* Many corrections and bug fixes.

* Added FMJ and HP versions of each round, with different stats

* Conversion of guns to full-auto/semi-auto, pump/semi, and ammo conversions are no longer required.
    Previously every gun had its own variation, on conversion the old gun was removed and replaced with
    the new variant.

* Guns can now be loaded with multiple ammo types at the same time. A 5.56 rifle can now have 5.56 FMJ,
    5.56 HP, .223 FMJ and .223 HP all in the same magazine. This applies to other guns as well 
    (ie: mixing buck and slugs in shotguns)

* Bullet penetration is no longer a simple true/false dependant on the gun item. Its now based on a % 
    chance, dependant on the bullet type (HP rounds have low chance of penetration while FMJ is higher),
    rechecked every round fired. Ideally this should check on every hit (ie: passing through multiple
    zombies) but its better then nothing.

* Gun damage is now dependant on the bullet type loaded. FMJ have a lower min damage, while HP is higher.

* The tooltip on inventory items now specifies what ammo type is currently loaded in a gun or magazine,
    and what fire mode (Full/Semi) a gun is currently using.

* Shotguns with buckshot loads now have a chance of missing.

* When reloading a revolver, if there are empty shells in the cylinder the entire cylinder contents are
    dumped out and all cylinder spots must be reloaded. You can not just replace the empty shells.

* Unloading bullets from magazines places rounds in inventory. Unloading from a gun drops rounds on the 
    ground (from racking the slide, or dumping out the cylinder)
    
* Context menu has been added to set a preferred ammo type on guns and magazines.
    (ie: load only 5.56 FMJ). This can be set to "Any" (loads any available ammo),
    any bullet type the gun is capable of using, or "Mixed Load" to specifically 
    mix ammo in the magazine.

* Context menu has been added for manually cocking/releasing the hammer, or opening/closing the slide/bolt.

* Context menu has been added for spinning the cylinder on rotary guns (ie: revolvers)

* Context menu has been added for shooting yourself in the head, curing infection so your corpse doesn't 
    come back as a zombie.  Note if done with a partially loaded revolver (russian roulette) it cures 
    boredom as well.
    
* Code is now called when pulling the trigger on a gun that won't fire (unloaded etc). This will properly
    drop the hammer, or in the case of doubleaction revolvers: cock, rotate and release.

* Speed Loaders and Stripper Clips have been separated from magazines and act independently.

* Clients on 'Easy Reloading' settings are effectively set to 'Normal'. This is a REAL GUNS MOD. Real guns
    have magazines.



Changes for modders and editors:

* All lua files have been rewritten and documented for maintainability. Much redundant repetitive code and 
    tables have been removed.

* Ammo has been renamed, using a new naming scheme: Ammo_<caliber>_<bullet_type>

* Ammo now has dummy generic rounds for each type. These dummy rounds are named simply Ammo_<caliber> without a 
    bullet type (ie: Ammo_223Remington is the dummy round, Ammo_223Remington_FMJ and Ammo_223Remington_HP are real 
    rounds). These dummy rounds should never be spawned or accessible to players. They do not have boxes or cans.
    However, when adding magazines or firearms, these dummy rounds should be used as the AmmoType instead of the 
    real rounds.

* Weapon damage and other attributes are now determined by the current round in the chamber, instead of the definitions
    in the .txt files. (see ORGMWeaponData.lua, ORGMAmmoStatsTable)

* ORGMDistributions.lua is now actually manageable. There is no longer a need to build guns or ammo tables. Or the
    WeaponsUpgrades table. These are now built automatically on loading the script using data from ORGMWeaponData.lua

* All weapon classes have been merged into a single class: ISORGMWeapon
    Guns are now defined by several properties that dictate how they handle:
    actionType - Auto, Lever, Rotary, Pump, Bolt, Break (barrel)
    triggerType - SingleAction, DoubleAction, DoubleActionOnly


* Overridden functions:
    ISUI/ISToolTipInv:render()
    Reloading/ISReloadManager:checkLoaded()
    Reloading/ISReloadManager:startReloadFromUi()
    
    *Reloading/ISReloadManager has several new functions injected into it.


********************************************************************************************************
TODO: 
* server side configuration .ini file to set various loot frequency per container type, and forced reloading difficulty
* tie item spawning into server frequency settings
* fix speedloaders and stripperclips
* add empty shells
* add more guns and ammo types!
