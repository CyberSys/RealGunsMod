This is a template example mod that tweaks ORGM's settings.

It is intended to be used by server operators and people who aren't happy with ORGM's
default settings, so they don't have to edit and redistribute ORGM's core settings.

Note when used for multiplayer servers, all players will need a copy of this mod, so 
you will have to upload it to the steam workshop or distribute it to your players in
another fashion.

DON'T FORGET to edit the mod.info file and change the id= line to something unique, or
players may have issues when having multiple custom settings mods in their mod folder.
