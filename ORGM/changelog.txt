---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
version 3.00

* Complete code rewrite. Replaced all global tables with a single ORGM table. This table contains 
    all functions and data. It is no longer necessary to directly edit ORGM's lua code to customize 
    it, every aspect of the mod can be edited/replaced by creating a extra patch mod.

* All guns now record the ORGM version number they were last used with. Guns that get changed in
    ORGM updates are logged in a 'internal changelog' of the version they were last changed in.
    Any 'in game' gun that has had obsolete stats will now reset to defaults values on equipping.
    Any ammo loaded will be placed in the players inventory.
    This allows for major changes to made to guns without breaking existing saves or breaking existing
    in game guns.

* Added a ORGM.Settings table to allow for easier configuration, these settings are meant to be overwritten 
    by extra 'patch mods' that can be loaded just like any normal PZ mod. Options include:
    
    JammingEnabled - enable/disable weapon jamming
    
    CasesEnabled - enable/disable ejecting of spent cases
    
    LogLevel (0 to 3) - control the amount of text printed to the logfile 
        (errors only, warnings, info or debug)
    
    RemoveBaseFirearms - enable/disable the removal of vanilla firearms and ammo
    
    DefaultMagazineReoadTime - control the time it takes to load bullets into a magazine 
        (unless the specific magazine overrides)
        
    DefaultReloadTime - control the time it takes to load a magazine into a firearm
        (unless the specific magazine overrides)

    DefaultRackTime - control the time it takes to rack a firearm. 
        (unless the specific magazine overrides)

    LimitYear - A spawn year cutoff, to remove spawning of guns manufactured after the specified year

    UseSurvivorsPatch - inject compatibility patch for Survivors mod.
    
    
    **Note the spawn modifier settings work in addition to the sandbox loot rarity settings.
    Its now possible to have melee weapons abundant and reduce firearm spawn settings to next to 
    nothing, or have lots of guns but limited ammo.


* Basic Firearm inspection window (accessed via context menu for guns in hand). Showing details
    such as basic information on the gun, manufacturer, country of origin, initial production year, 
    as well as item specific info such as condition, round chambered, attachments etc.
    
* All guns that spawn naturally have serial numbers generated. Gun spawned with necroforge or other
    admin methods do not. This can be seen via the new firearm inspection window (immersion feature)

* Firearm/ammo/upgrades/repairkits are no longer required to have the ORGM mod prefix. It
    should now be possible to have other mods guns and ammo behave as ORGM weapons.

* When using the ORGM Silencers mod, silencers now correctly spawn in containers not attached
    to guns. Also, Silencers will now appear in necroforge.

* Item Spawning now obeys container weight limits.

* CZ75 Pistol is now a 9x19mm instead of .40S&W, fixed inconsistencies in magazine size.
    The txt file had it listed as 15, while lua data had 10.
    In reality, The CZ75 comes in both 9mm and .40, with magazine sizes of 15 for the 9mm 
    and 12 for the .40S&W

* Taurus P38S is now a double action instead of single action.

* Browning BLR is now single action instead of double action only, it now uses a detachable 4 round
    magazine instead of a internal one.

* Henry Big Boy is now single action instead of double action only.

* M1903 is now single action instead of double action only.

* H&K SL8 magazine capacity reduced from 20 to 10 (all SL8's imported into the US use 10 round mags)

* Increased durability of all weapons. 
    Pistols and SMG's now have a base chance of lowering condition 1-in-150 (was 100).
    Revolvers to 1-in-300 (was 200)
    Rifles and shotguns to 1-in-200 (was 100)
    Except the M249, which is now 1-in-500 (was 100)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
version 2.03 Stable

* Built in compatibility patch for Nolan's ORGM Silencers mod. Due to Rechambered code changes,
  Silencers will only spawn on guns, not in containers.
  
* Added code to allow survivors mod NPC's to spawn with gun upgrades. Fixed bug in preset survivors
  that spawned with Base.Huntingriflel (typo'd weapon name.. not my bug, but fixed anyways)

* Fixed bug not allowing some SMG's to mount lasers.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
version 2.02 Stable

* Built in compatibility patch for necroforge and survivors mod.

* fixed bug not allowing SMG's to mount reflex and red dot sights


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
version 2.01 Stable

* Reduced Shotgun spread to more realistic values

* Removed screw-on shotgun chokes as a upgrade for sawnoff models.

* Fixed bug causing excessive ammo spawning in storage units


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.00 Changes of Note:

* Complete code rewrite and cleanup.

* Many corrections and bug fixes.

* Weapon and ammo spawn rates reduced, and now obey sandbox weapon loot rarity settings.

* Distant gunshot sounds now properly play in MP again.

* Added FMJ and HP versions of each round, with different stats

* Conversion of guns to full-auto/semi-auto, pump/semi, and ammo conversions are no longer required.
    Previously every gun had its own variation, on conversion the old gun was removed and replaced with
    the new variant.

* Guns can now be loaded with multiple ammo types at the same time. A 5.56 rifle can now have 5.56 FMJ,
    5.56 HP, .223 FMJ and .223 HP all in the same magazine. This applies to other guns as well 
    (ie: mixing buck and slugs in shotguns)

* Bullet penetration is no longer a simple true/false dependent on the gun item. Its now based on a % 
    chance, dependent on the bullet type (HP rounds have low chance of penetration while FMJ is higher),
    rechecked every round fired. Ideally this should check on every hit (ie: passing through multiple
    zombies) but its better then nothing.

* Gun damage is now dependent on the bullet type loaded. FMJ have a lower min damage, while HP is higher.

* The tooltip on inventory items now specifies what ammo type is currently loaded in a gun or magazine,
    and what fire mode (Full/Semi) a gun is currently using.

* Shotguns with buckshot loads now have a chance of missing.

* Increased durability of all firearms, especially revolvers.

* Guns now have a chance of jamming based on weapon condition. Racking the gun clears the jam. Revolvers
    and break barrels are not susceptible to jamming. Easy and Normal difficulty will auto rack to clear.
    At any rate, the jammed round will fall to the floor. This is affected by the lucky/unlucky traits.

* When reloading a revolver, if there are empty shells in the cylinder the entire cylinder contents are
    dumped out and all cylinder spots must be reloaded. You can not just replace the empty shells.

* Unloading bullets from magazines places rounds in inventory. Unloading from a gun drops rounds on the 
    ground (from racking the slide, or dumping out the cylinder)
    
* Guns now litter the ground with empty shells when firing. These can be collected, boxed or put in canisters
    like normal rounds.
    
* Context menu has been added to set a preferred ammo type on guns and magazines.
    (ie: load only 5.56 FMJ). This can be set to "Any" (loads any available ammo),
    any bullet type the gun is capable of using, or "Mixed Load" to specifically 
    mix ammo in the magazine.

* Context menu has been added for manually cocking/releasing the hammer, or opening/closing the slide/bolt.

* Context menu has been added for spinning the cylinder on rotary guns (ie: revolvers)

* Context menu has been added for shooting yourself in the head, curing infection so your corpse doesn't 
    come back as a zombie.  Note if done with a partially loaded revolver (russian roulette) it cures 
    boredom as well.
    
* Code is now called when pulling the trigger on a gun that won't fire (unloaded etc). This will properly
    drop the hammer, or in the case of doubleaction revolvers: cock, rotate and release.

* Speed Loaders and Stripper Clips have been separated from magazines and act independently, a gun can used
    both.

* Clients on 'Easy Reloading' settings are effectively set to 'Normal'. This is a REAL GUNS MOD. Real guns
    have magazines.
