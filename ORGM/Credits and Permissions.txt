ORGM Rechambered was created by ORMntMan and Fenris_Wolf.

************************************************************************
*** STEAM WORKSHOP PERMISSIONS

If you wish to modify and reupload this mod to the workshop, you must seek 
the permission of BOTH ORMntMan and Fenris_Wolf.  
ORMntMan can be reached through the steam workshop page, Fenris_Wolf through
theindiestone.com forums.

There are very few reasons why you would need to do so. 98% of ORGM can be 
overwritten with the use of extra patch mods without having to reupload the 
whole thing.

Uploading full custom versions creates issues: a fractured userbase and 
inability to receive bug fixes and feature upgrades among other things.

In the event permission is given, this file MUST be included, as well as the 
changelog.txt, your workshop page MUST link to the original ORGM page, as well 
as theindiestone.com forum thread, and credits to the authors must be given.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=514618604
https://theindiestone.com/forums/index.php?/topic/23237-orgm-rechambered/

Failure to comply with these simple terms will result in your mod getting flagged.


************************************************************************
*** NON-STEAM PERMISSIONS

If you wish to make a custom version available to your friends or server users,
with downloads hosted in a location other then the steam workshop, you are free
to do so WITHOUT permission from the original authors, however this file must be
included, as well as the changelog.txt and credits must be given.

*** Fenris_Wolf's ORGM Rechambered credits:

ORMntMan - Author of the original ORGM mod, who without his hard work this mod 
    wouldn't exist today, and for keeping the steam workshop page updated with
    the new versions.

Khaos - For helping to maintain the steam workshop page, providing support for 
    the steam users, bug testing, and generally inspiring me to keep going.
    
FinestHops/Legion - For having strict requirements for the newdawn server, without
    his input ORGM would not be nearly as customizable.
    
Arsenal26 - For pointing out issues with how some of the attachments work, and 
    indirectly convincing me to dig into the heart of PZ's firearm code to see how
    they really work.

Nolanritchie - For creating the ORGM silencers mod. Not that I approve of the use
    of silencers (I find they throw the game balance), but his mod inspires more
    people to use ORGM, which is something I definitely approve of ;)

The Indiestone team - for obvious reasons.
    
All the people listed below.
