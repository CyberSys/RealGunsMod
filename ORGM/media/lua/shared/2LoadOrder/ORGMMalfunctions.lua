    Checking malfunctions depends on a variety of factors:
    over all condition of the firearm
    how many rounds have been shot since the last time the firearm was cleaned. For some action types this is less important
        then others (ie: revolvers vs gas powered automatics)
    was WD-40 used and not been properly cleaned after? The use of WD-40 as a 'repair kit' is really quite incorrect. That
        stuff is NASTY for firearms. It creates extra dirt and gunk, strips away proper gun lubricants, and being a penetrating
        oil, can leak into ammo primers creating dud rounds.  It has its uses unseizing stuck parts, but without a proper 
        cleaning after it creates additional problems

    This table lists malfunctions caused by firearms in poor condition.  These should not be confused with
    actual mechanical failure (ie: broken parts), as they may not happen consistently. The firearm might 
    function normally, suffer a malfunction, then continue to function normally after without maintenance
    or repair.
